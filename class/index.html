                <h4> Stochastic gradient descent versus non-linear conjugate gradient for the Netflix Prize </h4>
                <h6> 5-10-2012 </h6>
                <p> I compare two common techniques to compute matrix
                factorizations for recommender systems, specifically using the
                Netflix prize data set. Accuracy, run-time, and scalability are
                discussed for stochastic gradient descent and non-linear
                conjugate gradient. <a href="netflix2.pdf"> pdf</a>

                <h4> Naive Bayes for multiclass text classification </h4>
                <h6> 3-26-2012 </h6>
                <p> 
                This was a part of a homework assignment from Jake Hofman's 
                <a href="http://jakehofman.com/ddm/"> Data-driven Modeling course</a>. 
                Task: given the text of an article from the New York Times, predict the 
                section to which the article belongs. First step was registering for the NYT
                developer API and using it to get articles. The classifier was able to produce
                greater than 90% accuracy on a withheld test data set.

                <h4> Optimal Power Grid Attack </h4>
                <h6> 5-11-2011 </h6>
                <p>I study a continuous formulation of the so-called N-k problem: given a power grid,
                find a small set of lines whose failure will cause maximum damage. Instead of removing lines
                from the grid, I consider increasing their impedance continuously, and attempt to maximize
                the resulting disruption to stable voltages. For all test cases, I show that a fast and 
                simple first-order optimization method finds the same set of lines as more sophisticated
                techniques. <a href="optimal_power_grid_attack.pdf">pdf</a> </p>
                <h4> Crime PDE </h4>
                <h6> 12-17-2010 </h6>
                <p>The evolution in space and time of crime risk and criminal density is modeled by a coupled
                system of partial differential equations, and solved with a semi-implicit method using finite 
                differences. Under appropriate conditions, isolated stationary hot spots of high criminal activity
                form. <a href="Harnett_Jenkinson_PDEProject.pdf"> pdf </a></p>
                <p style="color:red">UPDATE 12-19-2010: I did more stuff </p>
                <p> I was playing with this more over the weekend and
                implemented the spectral methods we said we'd try next. They
                work well, and about three times faster than the finite
                differences we used before. I then found parameters to get
                different size hot spots like in the Short paper. Attached are
                images of the different sized hot spots and the new code, which
                fits on a single screen.

                <img src="eta04.png" style="height:300px" />
                <p> We didn't mention this in our paper, but when we coded it
                up, we used the notation from the other Short paper which we
                didn't reference.  It's equivalent but looks a little different
                in a couple spots.
                <p> Here are animations. I think the weird "shimmying" effect
                on the previous one was from taking too large a time step.

                <h4> The Netflix Prize: Alternating Least Squares in MPI</a> </h4>
                <h6> 3-5-2010 </h6>
                <p> I solve the netflix problem on a distributed memory machine using MPI and
                alternating least squares. <a href="Netflix_ALS.pdf"> pdf</a> </p>
