            <h5> 1-25-15 </h5>
            <p> Scikit-learn's batch logistic regression doesn't support a binomial response -- where your data is (successes, trials) rather than (success or failure). This can be a drag when you have a lot of trials with the exact same features, as your design matrix will be repetitive and much larger than necessary. </p>
            <p> It isn't too bad to do it yourself without scikit-learn though, which I show in

            <h3> Wikipedia link graph, MapReduce, PageRank </h3>
            <h5> 12-1-12 </h5>
            <p> As an excuse to play with some Amazon Web Services credit
            ($100) I got from a class, I decided to mess around with the <a
                href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/"> Wikipedia
                link graph</a>. The main file expands to 20GB+ and is in an
            inconvenient format, and so Amazon's Elastic MapReduce was a useful
            tool to parse it in a reasonable amount of time and build the
            graph.

            <p> The files: 
            <ul> 
                <li> enwiki-latest-pagelinks.sql.gz -- Contains most of the
                information needed to build the graph. It's a MySQL dump where
                rows contain triples of the form (from page ID, namespace, to
                page name). Annoyingly, the "to pages" are given with their
                text name which needs to be converted to an ID.  The next file
                includes the necessary info to do the mapping. We are only
                concerned with the "Main" namespace; the others (e.g. Talk and
                Help pages) should be discarded. </li>
                <li> enwiki-latest-page.sql.gz -- Contains information for each
                page, in particular both its text name and integer ID. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> I launched an EC2 instance, downloaded the files, unzipped them,
            then pushed them onto S3. The pagelinks.sql file is so large that
            this wasn't completely straightforward. I ended up using <a href="
                https://github.com/boto/boto">boto</a> to push it up in smaller
            2GB chunks.

            <p> With the graph built, it's a pretty staightforward task to
            build the in and out degree distributions. For fun, I used EMR to
            do this as well, though it's a simple enough task to run on single
            machine. I should include some comments and graphs on the
            distributions here. (UPDATE: I did this, see below)

            <p> Next I tried for each page to compute the top ten most similar 
            pages based on out-link structure. I failed to do this, and gave up
            after exhausting my $100 budget. It's a tough task to parallelize, 
            and similar to k-nearest neighbors in that each subtask needs to
            know the whole graph. I've read of clever ways to combat this, e.g.
            locality-based hashing, but didn't get around to implementing any.

            <p> The next step is PageRank, a fairly straightforward linear
            algebra problem. This can be parallelized easily (just matrix-vector
            multiplication) but needs to chain together multiple MapReduce tasks.
            I couldn't find a simple way to do this within the EMR framework,
            though I bet there is a way to do it.

            <p> The wikipedia graph is small enough, however, that it might fit
            into memory on a single machine. I haven't gotten around to doing
            this yet.

            <h5 style="color:red"> UPDATE </h5>
            <p> The wikipedia graph does indeed fit into memory, 2GB as a
            sparse matrix in scipy. I implemented PageRank and played with it a
            bit, nothing too exciting. I should put together a graph or table
            or something. (UPDATE: I did this, see github link below)
            <p> Also,  I am told that Pig is a good tool for doing high-level
            mapreduce jobs and it can be used on AWS. I should look into that. 

            <h5 style="color:red"> UPDATE 12-30-13 </h5>
            <p> <a href="https://twitter.com/lukestanley">Luke Stanley</a> 
            actually needed to use this for a real purpose. I helped him out;

            <h3> Balls and bins </h3>
            <h5> 3-28-12 </h5>
            <p> My friend Chris posed this problem:
            <div style="font-style:italic">
                <p> Imagine an array of N cups.  High above the cups you drop M ping 
                    pong balls, so that the probability of a ball entering any cup is 
                    totally uniform.
                <p> What is the expected number of occupied cups (or empty cups, 
                    whatever)?  Assume each cup is big enough to hold all M balls 
                    should they all fall in one.
            <h5> Application: </h5>
            <p> When I worked on a medical imaging device, we used these things called 
                solid state photo multipliers.  The way it works is exactly analogous 
                to dropping in M photons into N boxes and counting the non empty boxes.  
                We always assumed that K non-empty boxes implied K incident photons 
                (which is a solid approximation for M &lt;&lt; N), but I was always curious 
                about how to account for saturation effects once M ~ N.

            <p> <a href="fun/balls.pdf"> solution</a> (pdf)
            <h5 style="color:red"> UPDATE </h5>
            <p> My solution is way too complicated. There is a much easier way
            to go about it by using the linearity of expectation; that is, the
            expected number of non-empty cups is simply the sum over all cups
            of the probability that a particular cup is non-empty (since the
            cups are independent). It also allows a simple answer to the
            follow-up question: what is the limit as N goes to infinity of E[#
            bins filled from N balls in N bins]/N ? Both the simpler solution
            and the follow up question are left as an exercise for you. (It really
            is pretty straightforward and satisfying, try it.)
